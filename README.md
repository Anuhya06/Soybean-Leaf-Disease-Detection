# Soybean-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Develop and implement an accurate and efficient deep learning model (SoyNet DNN) for Soybean leaf disease detection, ensuring early diagnosis and timely intervention to protect crop health
Implemented resilient image preprocessing techniques to extract essential phenotypic information from Soybean leaf images. This step ensures high-quality data for accurate disease detection and facilitates feature extraction for deep-learning models.
