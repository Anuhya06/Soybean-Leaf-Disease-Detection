# Soybean-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Develop and implement an accurate and efficient deep learning model (SoyNet DNN) for Soybean leaf disease detection, ensuring early diagnosis and timely intervention to protect crop health
Implemented resilient image preprocessing techniques to extract essential phenotypic information from Soybean leaf images. This step ensures high-quality data for accurate disease detection and facilitates feature extraction for deep-learning models.
Optimize and enhance proposed methods (scalable K-means) using scalability by integrating Apache Spark into the existing system. Which facilitates faster and more parallelized processing of large datasets, and improves overall system efficiency.
